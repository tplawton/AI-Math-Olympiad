# AI-Math-Olympiad

### Leveraging LLM to Solve Complex Mathematical Problems

Adapted the DeepSeekMath language model for LaTeX input and fine-tuned the model to improve its performance on Olympiad-level math problems.

Implemented machine learning techniques including self-consistency mechanisms, iterative generation, and prompt engineering to significantly improve the modelâ€™s accuracy.
